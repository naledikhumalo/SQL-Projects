### Overview

### Project Goals
The main objectives of this data cleaning project are:
- **Correcting invalid data entries**
- **Removing duplicates**
- **Handling missing values**
- **Standardizing formats** for consistency
- **Improving data quality** for subsequent analysis or machine learning processes

### SQL Scripts
The SQL script in this repository is organized to execute various cleaning tasks, including:
1. **Identifying and removing duplicates**: Ensures no redundant data affects results.
2. **Handling missing values**: Replacing or deleting NULLs based on the dataâ€™s nature.
3. **Standardizing formats**: Ensures that dates, strings, and numeric fields adhere to consistent formats.
